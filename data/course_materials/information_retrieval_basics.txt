PageRank Algorithm:
PageRank is a link analysis algorithm used by Google Search. It assigns a numerical weight to each element of a hyperlinked set of documents. The algorithm was named after Larry Page, one of the founders of Google.

The basic idea is that important pages receive more links from other pages. PageRank can be calculated iteratively using the formula:
PR(A) = (1-d) + d * (PR(T1)/C(T1) + ... + PR(Tn)/C(Tn))

Vector Space Model:
The Vector Space Model (VSM) is an algebraic model for representing text documents as vectors of identifiers. Documents and queries are represented as vectors in a multi-dimensional space.

TF-IDF:
Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency is a numerical statistic that reflects how important a word is to a document in a collection. TF-IDF increases proportionally to the number of times a word appears in the document.

Boolean Retrieval:
Boolean retrieval uses Boolean logic (AND, OR, NOT operators) to match documents to queries. It's a simple but effective approach for structured queries.

Inverted Index:
An inverted index is a data structure that maps terms to the documents that contain them. It's the fundamental data structure in information retrieval systems.
